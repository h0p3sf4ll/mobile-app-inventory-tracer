# Mobile App Inventory Tracer

Mobile App Inventory Tracer is a default-first Azure DevOps scanner that identifies mobile applications across large Git estates, extracts app metadata, captures contributor and activity signals, and writes Excel-ready inventory reports as the scan runs.

It is designed for engineering, platform, security, and enterprise architecture teams that need a reliable inventory of mobile codebases without cloning every repository or depending on broad keyword search.

## Highlights

- Scans each repository's configured default branch, with a controlled deploy-branch fallback when none is set
- Detects Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Expo, Ionic, Capacitor, Cordova, Xamarin, and .NET MAUI signals
- Parses structured manifests and project files instead of relying on naive keyword matching
- Extracts app name, version, bundle/package identifier, source of identifier, contributors, and latest branch activity
- Splits Excel output into active and older branch worksheets, defaulting to `Active 90d` and `Older 90d`
- Streams CSV and JSON rows while the scan is running
- Optionally enriches detected identifiers with public Apple App Store and Google Play metadata
- Runs as a Python package, CLI, importable library, or Docker container
- Keeps Azure DevOps access read-only and fetches only allow-listed metadata/configuration files

## How It Works

The scanner uses the Azure DevOps REST API to list projects, repositories, default-branch tree items, selected file contents, and commit history. For each repository, it scans the branch in Azure DevOps `defaultBranch`, such as `main`, `master`, `develop`, or another configured default.

If Azure DevOps does not report a default branch for a repository, the scanner resolves one fallback branch instead of scanning every branch. It first checks Azure DevOps build definitions for repository-linked branch settings and branch filters. If no pipeline-associated branch can be resolved, it selects the strongest deployment-like branch name from the repo refs, prioritizing names such as `production`, `prod`, `preprod`, `release`, `main`, `master`, `development`, `develop`, and `dev`.

Azure DevOps does not provide a single universal "production branch" field across all repos and deployment models. Pipeline fallback is therefore best-effort and depends on build definitions being available to the PAT. Release pipelines, external deployment systems, and manually deployed branches may not be visible through the read-only Code APIs.

It fetches only files that can provide strong mobile signals or metadata, such as:

- `AndroidManifest.xml`
- `Info.plist`
- `InfoPlist.strings`
- `project.pbxproj`
- `.xcconfig`
- `build.gradle`
- `build.gradle.kts`
- `gradle.properties`
- `package.json`
- `app.json`
- `expo.json`
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `.csproj`
- `.props`
- `capacitor.config.*`
- `ionic.config.json`
- `config.xml`
- Azure pipeline YAML files

Detection is evidence-based. A repository branch is included when structured signals meet the configured confidence threshold. Generic `.csproj` files, generic `config.xml` files, and weak pipeline-only clues are not enough on their own to classify a repository as an app.

## What It Detects

| Category | Strong signals |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android manifest, Gradle Android application plugin, `applicationId`, `namespace`, `versionName` |
| iOS | `Info.plist`, `InfoPlist.strings`, Xcode build settings, bundle identifiers, marketing version |
| Flutter | `pubspec.yaml` Flutter SDK dependency with native project layout |
| React Native / Expo | `package.json`, Expo config, native Android/iOS project layout |
| Ionic / Capacitor / Cordova | Capacitor config, Cordova widget config, Ionic config, package dependencies |
| Xamarin / MAUI | `.csproj`, `UseMaui`, mobile target frameworks, `ApplicationId` |
| Mobile pipelines | Mobile build/task evidence as supporting context |

## App Metadata Extraction

When possible, the scanner extracts:

- `mobile_name`, such as `Agsnap`
- `mobile_version`, such as `1.0.2`
- `mobile_identifier`, such as `com.pepsico.agsnap`
- `mobile_identifier_source`, such as `Info.plist`, `Gradle applicationId/namespace`, or `Xcode build settings`
- `mobile_identifier_status`, either `found` or `missing_from_scanned_files`

It resolves common indirection patterns before deciding that an identifier is missing:

- Gradle property placeholders such as `${appId}`
- Xcode build setting placeholders such as `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`
- MSBuild `.props` values
- iOS plist references
- Android string resources for display names

The scanner does not invent identifiers. If a repo generates identifiers from CI/CD variables, private variable groups, secrets, flavors, external files, or runtime build logic that is not present in Azure DevOps, the identifier is reported as missing.

## Store Enrichment

Store lookup is optional and disabled by default. Enable it with `--store-lookup`.

When enabled:

- Apple App Store lookup uses the detected bundle identifier against Apple public lookup data
- Google Play lookup checks the public app details page by package identifier
- Results are cached by identifier and platform during the scan
- Lookup runs only after a resolved branch has already been classified as mobile

Google Play public lookup can confirm public listings, but it cannot see private/internal apps or Play Console-only listings. Authenticated Google Play Developer API support can be layered in separately for organizations that own the apps and can provide Android Publisher OAuth credentials.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Azure DevOps PAT with read access to Projects and Code
- Optional Azure DevOps Build read access for pipeline-associated fallback branches when a repo has no default branch
- Network access to `dev.azure.com`
- Optional network access to Apple and Google Play endpoints when `--store-lookup` is enabled

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h0p3sf4ll/mobile-app-inventory-tracer.git
cd mobile-app-inventory-tracer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

Set your Azure DevOps token as an environment variable:

```bash
export ADO_PAT="your-token-here"
```

## Quick Start

Scan every project in an Azure DevOps organization:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports
```

Scan one project:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer --org PepsiCoIT --project "Go_To_Market" --out-dir reports
```

Only include medium and high confidence matches:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports --min-confidence medium
```

Fast profile for very large organizations:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer \
  --org PepsiCoIT \
  --out-dir reports \
  --min-confidence medium \
  --max-workers 12 \
  --branch-workers 32 \
  --content-workers 32 \
  --activity-mode latest
```

Enable public store enrichment:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports --store-lookup --store-country US
```

The legacy command remains available for compatibility:

```bash
ado-mobile-scanner --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports
```

You can also run from source:

```bash
python mobile_app_inventory_tracer.py --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports
```

## Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t mobile-app-inventory-tracer .
```

Run a scan and write reports to a local directory:

```bash
mkdir -p reports
docker run --rm \
  -e ADO_PAT="$ADO_PAT" \
  -v "$PWD/reports:/reports" \
  mobile-app-inventory-tracer \
  --org PepsiCoIT \
  --out-dir /reports \
  --min-confidence medium
```

Run with public store enrichment:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e ADO_PAT="$ADO_PAT" \
  -v "$PWD/reports:/reports" \
  mobile-app-inventory-tracer \
  --org PepsiCoIT \
  --out-dir /reports \
  --store-lookup \
  --store-country US
```

The container runs as a non-root `scanner` user and writes to `/reports`.

## Outputs

The scanner creates output files as soon as the run starts and appends matching rows as resolved branches are detected:

- `ado_mobile_repos.csv`
- `ado_mobile_repos.json`
- `ado_mobile_repos.xlsx`

The Excel workbook includes:

- `Active 90d`: matched app branches changed within the active window
- `Older 90d`: matched app branches with no changes inside the active window

If you change `--branch-age-days`, worksheet names change accordingly, such as `Active 60d` and `Older 60d`.

## Library Usage

The scanner can be embedded in another Python application.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mobile_scanner import ScanConfig, scan_to_reports

config = ScanConfig(
    org="PepsiCoIT",
    pat="your-token-here",
    project=None,
    out_dir=Path("reports"),
    out_prefix="ado_mobile_repos",
    max_workers=8,
    branch_workers=16,
    content_workers=16,
    max_commits_per_repo=2000,
    timeout_seconds=30,
    min_confidence="medium",
    branch_age_days=90,
    activity_mode="contributors",
    store_lookup=True,
    store_country="US",
    store_timeout_seconds=15,
)

results, csv_path, json_path, xlsx_path = scan_to_reports(config)
```

Use `scan(config)` to receive rows without writing reports:

```python
from mobile_scanner import scan

rows = scan(config)
```

Stream rows into another process:

```python
from mobile_scanner import scan

def handle_row(row):
    print(row["project"], row["repo_name"], row["branch_name"], row["mobile_identifier"])

rows = scan(config, on_result=handle_row)
```

```

## Accuracy Notes

`mobile_identifier` can be empty when an app identifier is generated outside the files available to the scanner. Common causes include CI/CD variables, private variable groups, build flavors, environment-specific files, secrets, or app catalog packaging steps.

`mobile_name` can be empty when the display name is localized, generated, or declared only in native project files that are not present in the scanned branch.

`mobile_version` can be empty when versioning is generated by pipeline tasks, Gradle logic, Xcode build settings, or environment-specific files.

Placeholder versions such as `999.999.999` are treated as sentinel values and suppressed so they are not mistaken for release versions.

Store metadata is not the same as source metadata. App Store and Google Play values reflect public listing data where available; branch timestamps reflect repository activity.

## Performance Guidance

Start with:

```bash
mobile-app-inventory-tracer --org PepsiCoIT --out-dir reports --max-workers 8 --content-workers 16 --min-confidence medium
```

For very large organizations, the scanner uses three independent pools:

- `--max-workers` prepares repositories and resolves default or fallback branches
- `--branch-workers` scans resolved branches after they are prepared
- `--content-workers` fetches selected manifest and configuration files

Increase concurrency only if Azure DevOps responds quickly and throttling is not observed. Reduce it if you see `429`, timeout, or transient service errors.

Contributor extraction happens only after a resolved branch passes detection. Use `--max-commits-per-repo` if full commit history is too expensive for large estates.

Use `--activity-mode latest` for the fastest large-org inventory pass. It captures `last_updated` from the latest branch commit and leaves `contributing_developers` empty, avoiding full commit-history walks. Use `--activity-mode contributors` when the complete contributor column matters more than speed.

Store lookup is also performed only after detection. Leave `--store-lookup` off for the fastest inventory scan.

## Security

- Use a read-only Azure DevOps PAT scoped to the smallest practical set of projects and repositories
- Prefer `ADO_PAT` over `--pat` so tokens are not stored in shell history
- Do not commit generated reports if they may contain internal repository names or contributor emails
- The scanner does not clone repositories
- The scanner fetches only allow-listed source/configuration files needed for detection
- Docker runs as a non-root user

## Testing

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m compileall ado_mobile_scanner.py mobile_app_inventory_tracer.py mobile_scanner tests
```
